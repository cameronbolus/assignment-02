        <h1>Hello.</h1>
        <p>
          Mark Boulton Design was a small design studio. In<br>
          2014, <span class="blue">we were acquired by Monotype</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, we <span class="blue">built an amazing team</span> and worked<br>
          on some <span class="blue">tremendous projects with the smartest<br>
          clients</span>. That's something we're proud of, and thankful<br>
          for. But, it's time for a change.
        </p>
        <p>
          The move to Monotype brings us closer to the<br>
          problems we want to fix. Mark Boulton Design is now<br>
          closed. The team will be working on Monotype<br>
          projects from the same premises in the UK and we'll<br>
          still be writing, still blogging, and still speaking at web<br>
          conferences. We're not going anywhere.
